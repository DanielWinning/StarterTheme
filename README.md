# WordPress Starter Theme

A *classic* starter theme/scaffold for quick theme development. Includes:

- VueJS
- Tailwind
- SASS
- Webpack

Requires:
- NPM
- PHP 7.2+
## How to use?
- Click "use this template"
- Clone your new repo into a WordPress installation, inside the themes directory
- `cd` into the theme directory (`cd wp-content/themes/StarterTheme`)
- run `npm install`
- run `npm run dev` or `npm run watch`
- run `npm run build` to build the production version

You do not need to deploy the `src` directory to your server. But you can, it doesn't hurt.
